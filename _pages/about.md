I am a second-year master’s student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University and will complete my M.S. degree in June 2026. I intend to pursue a PhD degree beyond my master’s program and will remain a student following the summer of 2026.

My work focuses on tactile-informed control and robotic sensing, with hands-on experience in developing wearable sensing systems and integrating sensor data with control and learning pipelines. I am currently working in the [Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Lab (BDML)](https://bdml.stanford.edu) led by Professor [Mark Cutkosky](https://bdml.stanford.edu/people/mark-cutkosky), developing a motion-capture glove for high resolution hand tracking.

I received my bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University, where I worked on UAV control in [FASTLab](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab) under Professors [Fei Gao](https://feigao-robotics.com/) and [Yanjun Cao](https://fast-fire.space/author/yanjun-cao-%E6%9B%B9%E7%87%95%E5%86%9B/).

I am currently seeking a Summer 2026 internship in robotics, sensing, or control.

    <p>
      • Led the design of a modular Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based wearable sensing prototype to capture high-resolution finger motion and normal force while maintaining wearing comfort.  
      • Developed and validated a first-generation single-finger sensing module, including finger bending and tactile force measurement.  
      • Built a multi-camera vision system and integrated pose estimation to provide ground-truth validation of sensing accuracy.  
      • Established a scalable foundation for collecting high-quality human demonstration data for tactile-informed control and imitation learning in contact-rich robotic tasks.
