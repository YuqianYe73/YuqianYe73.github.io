I am a second-year master’s student in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford University and will complete my M.S. degree in June 2026. I intend to pursue a PhD degree beyond my master’s program and will remain a student following the summer of 2026.

My work focuses on tactile-informed control and robotic sensing, with hands-on experience in developing wearable sensing systems and integrating sensor data with control and learning pipelines. I am currently working in the Biomimetics and Dexterous Manipulation Lab (BDML) led by Professor Mark Cutkosky, developing a motion-capture glove for high-resolution hand tracking.

Previously, I received my bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University, where I worked on UAV control in the FAST Lab under Professors Fei Gao and Yanjun Cao.
